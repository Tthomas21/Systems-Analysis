System Design &amp; Business Requirements


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass client and its owner Liam are company that want to help drivers be more readily and able to pass their driving exam. Liam stated the reason people fail their drivers exams is because they lack training and experience due to the current driving programs available.

What did you do particularly well?
I felt what I did very well with this project is the UML diagrams, I believe I made their very intuitive and clearly met the needs of the client, and also the type of users and the interactions they needed to have with the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the part of my work I would choose to revise is the business requirements document. I believe I could have put more effort in to how the system should be secured. I think considered security features is going to be one of if not the most important aspect of the design. So I would put more effort into ensure the software is securely written and designed to protect the client and its users.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The way I interpreted the user's needs is by considered what actions they would need to be able to complete. Such as logging into the system. Thus, I implemented a user profile creation, password authentification, and encryption to keep the login process secure. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The approach I took to designing software was the SDLC approach. SDLC is broken in to phases of Requirement gathering & analysis, which the process of interviewing the client and potentially thier users. Designing the system based on the client & users needs, then implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance of the system. I would use all of the approaches in the future, I believe the SDLC method is very effective.
